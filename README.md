# odin-recipes

This project will include a multi-paged website which lists and describes multiple recipes for common household foods. It will contain images, ingredients and procedures on how to cook these delicious cuisines.

I will demonstrate skills such as, linking multiple web pages, including images, creating emphasized and bolded text, creating a wide variety of headers, and organizing my text all within HTML code.
